        <h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>
        <h2>1. Planning</h2>
        <p>The planning phase is crucial for any project as it lays the foundation. During this phase, the project's objectives, scope, and purpose are defined. Stakeholders' requirements are gathered, and feasibility studies are conducted to ensure the project's viability.</p>

        <h2>2. Feasibility Study</h2>
        <p>This phase involves analyzing the feasibility of the project in terms of cost, time, and resources. The goal is to determine whether the project is practical and achievable within the given constraints.</p>

        <h2>3. System Design</h2>
        <p>During the system design phase, the overall system architecture is designed. This includes defining the system's components, modules, interfaces, and data flow. Detailed specifications are created to guide the development process.</p>

        <h2>4. Implementation</h2>
        <p>The implementation phase involves translating the system design into actual code. Developers write the code for the various system components and integrate them into a functional system. This phase also includes unit testing to ensure each component works correctly.</p>

        <h2>5. Testing</h2>
        <p>In the testing phase, the entire system is tested to identify and fix any defects or issues. Various types of testing, such as functional, performance, and security testing, are performed to ensure the system meets the specified requirements and works as expected.</p>

        <h2>6. Deployment</h2>
        <p>Once the system passes all tests, it is deployed to the production environment. This phase involves installing and configuring the system for end-users. User training and documentation are also provided to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

        <h2>7. Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The maintenance phase begins after the system is deployed. It involves monitoring the system for any issues, providing ongoing support, and making necessary updates and enhancements. This phase ensures the system remains functional and up-to-date over time.</p>
